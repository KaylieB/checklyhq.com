<h1 id="privacy-policy">Privacy policy</h1>

<p>Last Updated: February 8, 2018</p>

<hr />

<p>Checkly provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and
disclosure of information received from users of this website, located at <a href="https://checklyhq.com">https://checklyhq.com</a> (&ldquo;Site&rdquo;), as well as all
related websites, applications, and other services provided by us (collectively, together with the Site, our “Service”).</p>

<p>By using our Service you are consenting to our Processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now
and as amended by us. &ldquo;Processing&rdquo; means using cookies on a computer or using or accessing such information in any way,
including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which
activities may take place in the United States.</p>

<h2 id="information-collection-and-use">Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>Our primary goals in collecting information from you are to provide you with the products and services made
available through the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one.</p>

<p>We may also use your information to operate, maintain, and enhance the Service and its features, and to provide customer support to users.</p>

<h2 id="information-collected-upon-registration">Information Collected Upon Registration</h2>

<p>You provide us with information when you register for an account, use the Service, make a purchase on the
Service, or send us customer service-related requests. If you desire to have access to certain restricted
sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally
identifiable information to Checkly. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the
Service, or if you desire to receive marketing materials and information. Information that we may collect in
such instances may include your IP address, full user name, password, email address, city, time zone,
credit card and other billing information, preferences, telephone number, and other information that you decide
to provide us with. We may link such information with other information you provide about yourself.</p>

<h2 id="use-of-google-and-or-github-user-data">Use of Google and/or Github User Data</h2>

<p>If you choose to connect a Google profile or Github profile to your Checkly account, we will access certain information
obtained from Google regarding your account. In particular we may store your name and email address.
This data will only be used by Checkly to provide you with the service you expect and will not be shared with any third parties.</p>

<h2 id="use-of-contact-information">Use of Contact Information</h2>

<p>In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about,
our products and services, including but not limited to our Service. If you decide at any time that you no
longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please un-follow us, or follow the unsubscribe
instructions provided in any of the communications. You may also opt out from receiving commercial email
from us by sending your request to us by email at support@checklyhq.com.</p>

<h2 id="log-data">Log Data</h2>

<p>When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you
visit a website (&ldquo;Log Data&rdquo;). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or
the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements
on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will
be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and of our Service, and
for the Site’s technical administration. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable
information to identify you personally.</p>

<h2 id="cookies-and-automatically-collected-information">Cookies and Automatically Collected Information</h2>

<p>Like many websites, we also use &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve
the Site and our Service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer&rsquo;s hard disk.
We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. Checkly may use both session cookies and
persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and our Service, to monitor aggregate
usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our services. A session
cookie enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when you
disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used
by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web
browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser,
by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to
utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential. Checkly does not process or respond to web browsers’
“do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who use our Service.</p>

<p>We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology,
including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may include your IP address
or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just
before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on
the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these
technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened,
clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with
other information about you.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-web-beacons-and-third-party-buttons">Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons</h2>

<p>We may display third-party content on the Service, including third-party advertising. Third-party content may
use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third
party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as the Facebook “share” button)
that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through
third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by Checkly.
Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection,
use, and disclosure policies.</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p>Checkly is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information.
Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot and do not guarantee that
information about you will not be accessed, viewed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our
administrative, physical, and electronic safeguards. We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach
of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you
via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay,
consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of
the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>
