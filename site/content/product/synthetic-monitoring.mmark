## How it works

<p class="text-center hero-sub hero-sub-center mb-5">
Checkly uses the Puppeteer & Playwright frameworks to accurately simulate interactions with a Chrome browser.
Getting a monitoring script going is a lot easier than you might think. Just follow the steps below and you'll be up in no time.
</p>


{{% feature-row header="Create a script" img="/product/transaction-monitoring/synthetic-howitworks-1@2x.png" %}}
Pick one of the examples from our built-in library as your starting point. Alternatively, you can install and fire up the
[Headless Recorder](/docs/headless-recorder/) browser extension and record a script in real-time as you click through your site.

{{% feature-row header="Tweak it" img="/product/transaction-monitoring/synthetic-howitworks-2@2x.png" %}}
Use our in app debugger to iterate on your script and directly see the results. Add extra assertions, screenshots
and navigation actions. Add the industry standard **Mocha and Chai libraries** for a familiar workflow.

{{% feature-row header="Run it every ten minutes" img="/product/transaction-monitoring/synthetic-howitworks-3@2x.png" %}}
Schedule your script to run as often as every ten minutes. A regular interval gives you an accurate insight into
how your vital transactions are performing over time. We also give you **full access to the log files** for each run in case
an alert is triggered.
