You can configure your run checks to run from an ever growing amount of global locations. We use [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)
to host our check runner infrastructure and follow the opening of new datacenter locations as close a possible, i.e. if 
a new location opens up, Checkly will be there very soon.

Current locations in Checkly are
