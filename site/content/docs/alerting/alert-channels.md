You can add as many of the following alert channels as you want: 

- Email
- Slack
- SMS
- Webhook
- Pagerduty

When adding a channel, you can select which checks to subscribe to the channel. This way you can create specific routings
for specific checks.

Configuring alert channels is mostly self explanatory except for our [advanced webhook builder](/docs/alerting/webhooks)

After adding the channels, you either **edit** or **delete** them, or change which checks are subscribed to that specific channel.
