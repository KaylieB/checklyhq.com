Checkly enables you to trigger **single checks or groups of checks** as you deploy your code from your CI/CD pipeline. 
You can integrate Checkly in your CI/CD pipeline in two ways:


The easiest way to get started is by using our GitHub integration to leverage the GitHub deployments API. This requires 
minimal setup and works great with providers like **Vercel** and **Heroku**.

- [GitHub deployments](/docs/cicd/github/)


You can also integrate with your CI/CD using our API directly:

- [CircleCI](/docs/cicd/circleci/)
- [Codeship](/docs/cicd/codeship/)
- [Heroku](/docs/cicd/heroku/)
- [Jenkins](/docs/cicd/jenkins/)
- [Travis CI](/docs/cicd/travisci/)
- [Vercel](/docs/cicd/vercel/)

For any other platform, check out how to use our command line trigger API:
