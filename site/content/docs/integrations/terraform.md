You can use [Hashicorp's Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to create and manage your checks. This allows you to completely keep
the definition of your checks in your code repository.

To get started, take the following steps:

1. Checkout the Checkly Terraform provider in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/bitfield/terraform-provider-checkly)
2. Build the provider and add it to your Terraform installation.
3. Write your first Checkly resource and apply it.
