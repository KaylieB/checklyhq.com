When inviting a team member to join your account you can assign one of three roles that all have different access patterns.

1. **Owner**
    - Can change the team name
2. **Admin**
    - Can invite, edit and remove other team members
    - Can change the account name
3. **Read & Write**
    - Can create, update and delete checks
    - Can create, update and delete alert setting
4. **Read Only**
    - Look, no touch.

Only the initial account creator has the **Owner** role. You can always change any assigned roles after a team mate has
joined your team.

> Roles are staggered, so any role higher up the totem pole has all the rights of the roles below him/her.
