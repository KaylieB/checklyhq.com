#### What's are API checks?

API checks are monitors that issue POST, GET and other typical HTTP requests at API endpoints. You have full control
over the payload, headers etc. In addition, you can create assertions to check if the response from your
API is valid and performant.

#### What are Browser checks?

Browser checks are monitors based on Node.js scripts using industry standard testing tools like Mocha and Puppeteer.
Each browser check uses an actual Chrome browser to execute clicks, fill out forms and validate if these interactions have 
the correct results.

#### Do all plans have the same scheduling options?

Yes, all plans allow 5 minute schedules and longer, up to once per day.
