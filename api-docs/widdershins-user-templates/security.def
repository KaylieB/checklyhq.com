# Authentication

The Checkly API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can manage your API keys in the
[Checkly account settings](https://app/checklyhq.com/account/api-keys). Your API key is like a password: keep it secure!

Authentication to the API is performed using the bearer auth method in the Authorization header.

For example, use `-H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>"` when using cURL.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail.
API requests without authentication will also fail.
