        h5 What is Puppeteer?
        p
          | #[a(href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer", target="_blank") Puppeteer] is a framework developed by Google's Chrome team. It enables developers to easily run standard Chrome
          | browsers in "headless" mode. Although it doesn't output anything to a screen it keeps all of its features for rendering a web page. To get you started with the Puppeteer framework, we created
          | the  Github repo #[a(href="https://github.com/checkly/puppeteer-examples", target="_blank") checkly/puppeteer-examples] with example scripts.
        h5 How is it different from PhantomJS or Selenium?
        p
         | PhantomJS and its partner library CasperJS are based on the QT Webkit browser. Also, they are not "native" Node.js applications.
         | Selenium and the Webdriver standard are Java applications that "talk to" browsers. Setup is complex and you always need Java.

        h5 Is there a roadmap?
        p
